# Axelrod Tournament

This is an implementation of the original Axelrod
tournament conducted by Professor Robert Axelrod in 1980.

Veritasium's [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mScpHTIi-kM) video provides an introduction to The Prisoner's Dilemma and the original tournament.<br>
It was also the inspiration for this project.

Know more about his research on the 
Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma and Game Theory [here](https://axelrod.readthedocs.io/en/fix-documentation/reference/description.html).

Code in this repository has been inspired by the original
[Axelrod](https://github.com/Axelrod-Python/Axelrod) python library.
